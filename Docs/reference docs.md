Reference Documents
===================

I previously had a copy of the old RS274 spec from way back in 1998 in this folder.

I have been contacted by Ucamco, the owner of the Gerber file format, and asked to replace the old 
document I have here with a like to the current version of the specification on their site. 

The old document is now well out of date and you an download the current version
for free, so a much better source for the specification.
