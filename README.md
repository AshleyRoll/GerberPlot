GerberPlot
==========

Gerber to HPGL conversion tool.

For more information, see

Please note, I no longer use or support this software, in fact
I no longer even have a build environment for it.

I get requests for the code periodically, so I have uploaded the 
code to this repo for all to access.

If you have any questions, let me know and I'll try to help when
I have time.

Cheers,
Ash. July 2013.
